Create a table to display information about the evaluation of predictions

 CREATE VIEW Like_Dislike
 AS  SELECT C.ID, C.COOKIE, M.LIKES, M.DISLIKES
 FROM METADATA M
 RIGHT JOIN COOKIES C 
 ON M.COOKIE_ID =C.ID;
 
Show the table 

 SELECT * FROM LIKE_DISLIKE ORDER BY ID;
 
Last registered users don't have voted. Remove them from the METADATA table.

 DELETE FROM METADATA 
 WHERE DISLIKES IS NULL AND LIKES IS NULL;

Re-display information, checks whether there are users, without assessing the predictions.

 SELECT ID, COOKIE , LIKES , DISLIKES 
 FROM LIKE_DISLIKE 
 WHERE EXISTS (
   SELECT *
   FROM LIKE_DISLIKE 
   WHERE DISLIKES IS NULL AND LIKES IS NULL
 );
 
Show the table 

 SELECT * FROM LIKE_DISLIKE ORDER BY ID;
